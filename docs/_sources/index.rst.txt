Python AEBM (ALPHA)
================================

This is pre-release software, and while we greatly appreciate you taking the time to test it and investigate our methods, it's important to note that it has not been peer reviewed.

This is a Python implementation of the HAZUS Advanced Engineering Building Module. It is largely a translation to Python of the work Charlie Kircher did for the ShakeCast AEBM Workbook.
